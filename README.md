I am to lazy to write an actuall readme so go ahead and install pryzma using this command:

```
pip3 install --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/IgorCielniak/Pryzma-programming-language.git
```
and run:
```
pryzma
```
and experiment with it yourself, you always have the 'documentation' that you can look thinks up in
